# Blog-Analytica
---
In Knoldus, Knolders have a great culture of writing blogs on new technologies that are learnt everyday by them, aiming to share the knowledge and thus improving every Knolder's knowledge.

While the culture has been proving to be really fruitful for Knolders, there are some issues being faced while continuing with this tradition.

- Some people are writing blogs just to increase blog count.
- Some are writing blogs just because they have to achieve the blog target decided by their team leaders.
- Some are writing blogs just because it counts in increment process.
- If you observe closely most of the people post blogs around one on ones or around self appraisal process.
- Some people get noticed when their blog get noticed or posted somewhere and some remain unnoticed.
- According to new blogging process, each and every person has to submit their blogs to team leaders, team leaders have to  review the blog and only team leader can post the blog, which makes posting process a little bit lengthier and also increases the workload of every team leader.

This project aims at making blogging fun for Knolders by introducing badges and tags in the blogging system.

1. There will be three types of badges which are bronze, silver and gold and rules to earn a badge will be :-
    - Every time a person get bloger of month for highest numbers of views than other then amazon voucher he/she will also earn a bronze badge.
    - Every time a personâ€™s blog get noticed somewhere(i.e on DZzone or any other site) than other then praise on slack or slack tacos he/she will also earn a silver  badge.
    - 10 bronze badges will convert into one silver badge means after earning 10 bronze badges your 10 bronze badges will convert into 1 silver badge.
    - 10 silver badges will convert into one gold badge means after earning 10 silver badges your 10 silver badges will convert into 1 gold badge.



2. These badges are not only for sake of praising but these badges will also help you to get power.
    - When a person got 5 bronze, 4 silver badges then person will get the reviewer rights means that person is now capable enough to maintain the blogs quality moreover he/she is capable enough to review blog of others but he/she can't post directly for that he need to iescalate the blog to his/her team leader.
    - When a person got 7 bronze, 6 silver and 2 golds badges then person will get the posting rights means that person is now capable enough to maintain the blogs quality moreover he/she is capable enough to review and post  blog of others.


3. Apart from badges there will be some tags also which are :-
    - Mr/Ms great content :- for a person that earns his/her first bronze badge.
    - Mr/Me consistent :- as soon as person earns 5 bronze badges
    - Mr/Ms Focused :- For a person that earns his/her first silver badge.
    - Mr/Ms Golden words :- For a person that earns his/her first gold badge.

This would motivate Knolders to write quality blogs to earn badges and tags, thus hoping to eliminate the problems mentioned above.
